## Build a client library

### Setup Savant

Linux or macOS

```
mkdir ~/savant
cd ~/savant
wget http://savant.inversoft.org/org/savantbuild/savant-core/1.0.0/savant-1.0.0.tar.gz
tar xvfz savant-1.0.0.tar.gz
ln -s ./savant-1.0.0 current
export PATH=$PATH:~/savant/current/bin/
```

You may optionally want to add `~/savant/current/bin` to your PATH that is set in your profile so that this change persists. You'll also need to ensure that you have Java >= 8 installed and the environment variable  `JAVA_HOME` is set.

### Building

Listing each client library build targets

```
sb --listTargets
```

Building a single library

To build a single client library, you'll want to have the corresponding repo checked out in the same parent directory.

For example, your directory structure should look something like the following:

```
fusionauth
├── fusionauth-client-builder
├── fusionauth-android-client
├── fusionauth-csharp-client
├── fusionauth-go-client
├── fusionauth-java-client
├── fusionauth-javascript-client
├── fusionauth-node-client
├── fusionauth-php-client
├── fusionauth-python-client
├── fusionauth-ruby-client
├── fusionauth-swift-client
├── fusionauth-typescript-client
└── go-client
```

The client builder will assume the project is in the same parent directory.

```
sb build-java
```

Building all clients

```
sb build-all
```
